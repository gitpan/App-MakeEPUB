=head1 How to create an EPUB ebook from RFCs

There are three steps to create an EPUB ebook from an RFC.

=over 4

=item 1.

Download the RFC from https://tools.ietf.org/html/

    wget https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2328 > download/rfc2328.html

=item 2.

Since the HTML RFCs from https://tools.ietf.org/html/ are not directly
suitable for use in an EPUB, clean up the HTML file with this script in the
directory I<< examples/rfc >>.

    bin/finish-htmlrfc.pl download/rfc2328.html > clean/rfc2328.html

=item 3.

Make the EPUB.

    make-epub -publisher IETF \
              -rights 'The Internet Society' \
	      -title RFC2328 \
              -spine rfc2328 \
	      -tocdepth 2 \
	      -output rfc2328.epub \
	      clean

=back

=head2 Check your EPUB ebook

If you happen to have installed epubcheck you can verify the EPUB

    epubcheck rfc2328.epub

If there are any problems with the HTML in the ebook,
try to repair them by adjusting the script I<< bin/finish-htmlrfc.pl >>.

If there are any problem with the rest of the EPUB please file a bug at
L<rt.pan.org|https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=App-MakeEPUB>.
